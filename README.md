This is an attempt to implement a system similar to the 1997 game Adventures in Shandalar. I started it with the intention of making significant modifications to the basic overworld system and deck builder. I was much too ambitious though. I barely finished cosmetic construction of the basic tableau before becoming discouraged by the slow progress.
